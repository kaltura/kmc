To release a KMC with RIA compiled in it you need to:

1. Install the RIA client on your machine  
2. Add this to your additional compiler arguments:
-include-libraries "C:/Program Files/RIATest 3/agent/RIATestAgent3.swc" ${flexlib}/libs/automation.swc ${flexlib}/libs/automation_dmv.swc ${flexlib}/libs/automation_agent.swc
3. build your project. 
4. With the new version add the RIA swf with _RIA (IE kmc_RIA.swf)
